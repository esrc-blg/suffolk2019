# R-syntax, data structures and types

## Seminar

In this session we introduce R-syntax, and data types.

### Functions

Functions are a set of instructions that carry out a specific task. Functions often require some input and generate some output. For example, instead of using the `+` operator for addition, we can use the `sum` function to add two or more numbers.

```{r}
sum(1, 4, 10)
```

In the example above, `1, 4, 10` are the inputs and `r sum(1, 4, 10)` is the output. A function always requires the use of parenthesis or round brackets `()`. Inputs to the function are called **arguments** and go inside the brackets. The output of a function is displayed on the screen but we can also have the option of saving the result of the output. More on this later.

### Getting Help

Another useful function in R is `help` which we can use to display online documentation. For example, if we wanted to know how to use the `sum` function, we could type `help(sum)` and look at the online documentation. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
help(sum)
```

The question mark `?` can also be used as a shortcut to access online help. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
?sum
```

Use the toolbar button shown in the picture above to expand and display the help in a new window.

Help pages for functions in R follow a consistent layout generally include these sections:

| | |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Description |A brief description of the function|
|Usage        |The complete syntax or grammar including all arguments (inputs)|
|Arguments    |Explanation of each argument|
|Details      |Any relevant details about the function and its arguments|
|Value        |The output value of the function|
|Examples     |Example of how to use the function|

### The Assignment Operator 

Now we know how to provide inputs to a function using parenthesis or round brackets `()`, but what about the output of a function? 

We use the assignment operator **`<-`** for creating or updating objects. If we wanted to save the result of adding `sum(1, 4, 10)`, we would do the following:

```{r}
myresult <- sum(1, 4, 10)
```

The line above creates a new object called `myresult` in our environment and saves the result of the `sum(1, 4, 10)` in it. To see what's in `myresult`, just type it at the console:

```{r}
myresult
```

Take a look at the **Environment** pane in RStudio and you'll see `myresult` there.

To delete all objects from the environment, you can use the **broom** button as shown in the picture above.

We called our object `myresult` but we can call it anything as long as we follow a few simple rules. Object names can contain upper or lower case letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), underscores (`_`) or a dot (`.`) but all object names must start with a letter. Choose names that are descriptive and easy to type.

|Good Object Names|Bad Object Names          |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|result           |a                         |
|myresult         |x1                        |
|my.result        |this.name.is.just.too.long|
|my_result        |                          |
|data1            |                          |

### Sequences

We often need to create sequences when manipulating data. For instance, you might want to perform an operation on the first 10 rows of a dataset so we need a way to select the range we're interested in. 

There are two ways to create a sequence. Let's try to create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the two methods:

1. Using the colon `:` operator. If you're familiar with spreadsheets then you might've already used `:` to select cells, for example `A1:A20`. In R, you can use the `:` to create a sequence in a similar fashion:

```{r}
1:10
```

1. Using the `seq` function we get the exact same result:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10)
```

The `seq` function has a number of options which control how the sequence is generated. For example to create a sequence from 0 to 100 in increments of `5`, we can use the optional `by` argument. Notice how we wrote `by = 5` as the third argument. It is a common practice to specify the name of argument when the argument is optional. The arguments `from` and `to` are not optional, se we can write `seq(0, 100, by = 5)` instead of `seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)`. Both, are valid ways of achieving the same outcome. You can code whichever way you like. We recommend to write code such that you make it easy for your future self and others to read and understand the code. 

```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)
```

Another common use of the `seq` function is to create a sequence of a specific length. Here, we create a sequence from 0 to 100 with length 9, i.e., the result is a vector with 9 elements.

```{r}
seq(from = 0, to = 100, length.out =  9)
```

Now it's your turn: 

- Create a sequence of **odd** numbers between 0 and 100 and save it in an object called `odd_numbers`

```{r class.source="collapsible"}
odd_numbers <- seq(1, 100, 2)
```

- Next, display `odd_numbers` on the console to verify that you did it correctly

```{r class.source="collapsible"}
odd_numbers
```

- What do the numbers in square brackets `[ ]` mean? Look at the number of values displayed in each line to find out the answer.

- Use the `length` function to find out how many values are in the object `odd_numbers`. 
    - HINT: Try `help(length)` and look at the examples section at the end of the help screen. 

```{r class.source="collapsible"}
length(odd_numbers)
```
