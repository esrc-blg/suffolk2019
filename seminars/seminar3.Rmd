# Data import (from csv, txt, and excel)

```{r, include = FALSE}
par(bg = '#fdf6e3')
```

## Seminar

In this section, we will load data in csv, txt, excel and R format. We will learn how to check and set our working directory.

### Setting up

We set our working directory. R operates in specific directory (folder) on our computer. We create a folder on where we save our scripts. We name the folder `suffolk2019`. Let's create the folder on our computers now (in finder on Mac and explorer on Windows).

Now, we set our working directory to the folder, we just created like so:

![](./img/setwdir.png)

Create a new R script and save it as day1.R to your `suffolk2019` directory. 

At the beginning of each new script, we want to clear the workspace. The workspace is stored in working memory on our computer. If we do not clear it for a new script, it becomes too full over time. Our computer will slow down and it will become difficult for us to know which objects are stored in working memory.

We check the contents of our workspce like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# check workspace
ls()
```

To remove a specific object, we use the `rm()` function which stands for remove. Within the round brackets, we put the name of the object we want to remove. We could remove the object `a` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# delete variable 'a' from workspace
rm(a)
```

At the beginning of each script, we should always clear the entire workspace. We can do so in the following way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# delete everything from workspace
rm( list = ls() )
```

You can also clear text from the console window. To do so press Crtl+l on Winowds or Command+l on Mac.


### setting up

Data comes in different file formats such as `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.RData`, `.dta` and many more. To know the file type of a file right click on it and view preferences (in Windows explorer or Mac finder).

### Importing a data set in `.csv` format

One of the most common file types is `.csv` which means comma seperated values. Columns are seperated by commas and rows by line breaks. 

The dataset's name is "non_western_immigrants.csv". To load it, we use the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
dat1 <- read.csv("non_western_immigrants.csv")
```
